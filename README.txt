README:

Due to time restrains and other problems some of the parts of the code is either missing, or a bit bugged. 
The plan was for the system to use the ATmega's timer function, but it corrupted some of our data when it was included, so it is not implemented.

Extra features:
Two game modes: Play until you get 10 points, or play until 1 point. Timer is not implemented.
Two ways to control the system: Control it with either joystick or sliders.
3 Difficulity settings: Not implemented yet, due to not having time to test out the PID values for the different difficulities.
